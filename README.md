## CAD-Projects
I learned to CAD as a result of VEX. We need to be able to effectively design a bot before heavily committing to one since it was more time effective.
Originally there was a dedicated person to CAD our designs in High school but he proved to be unreliable so I began picking up the knowledge and I came 
to use it more often in the VEX division of IEEE at Rutgers.
